{{< callout type="warning" >}}The Adventures In Time Wiki is currently undergoing a rework / renovation to bring it up to date with the most recent version. Some information might be outdated and / or inaccurate, we are currently working on it.

Thank you for your patience.{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}If you find any bugs / crashes, please create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Loqor/ait/issues/new) or ask for help in the support channel in the [Amble Labs](https://discord.gg/D5Et6Ux7BS) Discord.{{< /callout >}}

Welcome to the **Adventures In Time Wiki**! This wiki is constantly maintained to be up to date with the most recent version of AIT so you can get the best information of the mod, from useless features to useful blocks and even making datapacks or extra mods!

## Where do I get the most recent release?

AIT can be found on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ait) and can also be found on [Curseforge.](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adventures-in-time)

## AIT is fantastic! Is there anywhere I can talk about the mod?

Yes, in [Amble Labs' discord server](https://discord.gg/D5Et6Ux7BS) where you can talk about the mod, show off your interiors, post your AIT datapacks, pay to get beta previews and even play with other people in the **AIT Server**!

## I've made a super cool mod for AIT! But I don't know where to publish it?

Oooh! In the [AIT Additons](https://discord.gg/aYEtPD24bF) Discord server, we would love to make a channel dedicated to talking about your addon. You can share your progress, get bug reports and suggestions and even update people on the changes! People can also play with your addons with other **AIT Addons** in the **AIT Additions Minecraft Server!**

## Where can I start?

You can learn about the AIT mod in these tabs below:
