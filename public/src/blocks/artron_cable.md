## How Do I Use Them?

Artron cables used to connect [Generalized Subsystem Cores](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/generalized_subsystem_core) to the TARDIS' engine.  
You don't need to connect every core separately. If core blocks are touching, they can be connected to the engine as one group.
