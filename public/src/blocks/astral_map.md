## What Is It Used For?

An Astral Map lets you select and locate various structures located throughout the game. These can include:

*   Cult Stuctures
    
*   Ancient Cities
    
*   Villages
    

Clicking "SEARCH" applies the coordinates of the structure you selected to your TARDIS. Afterwards, you can travel there like usual.  
If a structure is not available or in search radius of the Astral Map, you will receive a 404 warning.

## How Do I Craft It?

An Astral Map is made using the blueprint on the Fabricator.
