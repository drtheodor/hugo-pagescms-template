#### Q: Is there a channel with all of the community addons?

A: Yes, however some developers have their own servers, like:

*   [AIT Extras](https://discord.gg/5JDKuzarcS)
    
*   [AWT](https://discord.gg/pR4H948328)
    

You can find the other addons in the addons channel on teh AmbleLabs discord server (make sure to get the AIT role first in `Channels & Roles`).

#### Q: What do I choose: datapack or mod for making an addon for AIT?

A: If you just want to add interiors, desktops, exterior and console variants, custom TARDIS names and etc., then feel free to create a datapack. Otherwise, making a mod is recommended. You can also use a datapack inside a mod.

#### Q: How do I make a mod addon?

A: If you want to make a mod addon, refer to [this article](../development/).

#### Q: How do I make a datapack addon?

A: If you want to make a datapack addon, refer to [this article](../datapacks/).

#### Q: I changed my interior and now I can't turn the power on!

A: You need to set up the [engine](../blocks/engine) again.

#### Q: Windows don't glow! (without Iris)

A: Make sure you have the power on. If you use Iris or any of its derivatives, make sure you're using 1.0.5+ of AIT, or 1.0.6+ if you're on Forge.

#### Q: The toyota console is all black!

A: Make sure you have the power on. If you use Iris or any of its derivatives, make sure you're using 1.0.5+ of AIT, or 1.0.6+ if you're on Forge.

Q: What mods are incompatible with AIT?

A: Below are currently known incompatibilities, if you know of any not listed here, please inform us!

*   Immersive Portals: stops people from entering / exiting the TARDIS.
    
*   No Nametag Render: will stop the control names from showing.
    
*   Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (C2ME): seems to break rift chunks and TARDIS growth.
    
*   Distant Horizons (when installed on the server): breaks TARDIS growth, causes server crashes when entering a TARDIS. Clientside plays like normal.

#### Q: The rendering is buggy with shaders!

#### Q: I got unfairly banned/I want to appeal my ban on the Discord/MC server!

A: Talk with people who have the mod council role, e.g. @thatrhynoguy.

#### Q: Can you add support for Immersive Portals / add your own BOTI

A: We will not officially support Immersive Portals due to it not playing well with our mod. We briefly supported it but it proved to have plenty of issues. We are adding our own BOTI system and have some of it implemented now, however it will take time. Please be patient, it will be out when it's done. You can join our Discord serer to get mod teasers and updates to know when it's done!
