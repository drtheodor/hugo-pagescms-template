# FABRICATING A SONIC SCREWDRIVER

to fabricate a sonic you're gonna need to find a blueprint for it; these blueprints can be found it all structures, you can see what the blueprint is for by pressing shift while hovering over it in your inventory. to use the blueprint you need a [fabricator](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/fabricator), next thing is to right-click the fabricator with the sonic blueprint, this will show all the items needed to fabricate the blueprint recipe I suggest going to get the items about now if you haven't already. once you have all the items needed you just right-click the fabricator while holding one of the items and the fabricator will take it, once you have placed all the items in the fabricator it will create the item, just right-click to obtain it, now that you have a sonic we can go on to getting coral fragments!

# OBTAINING A CORAL GROWTH

Now that you have a sonic screwdriver we can start getting coral fragments! nine coral fragments can used to make a coral growth which is key to growing a Tardis and a console for said Tardis, you can obtain coral fragments by right-clicking a [Rift](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/rift-chunks) with your sonic, a Rift is something that spawns in rift chunks that can be found using a [Rift Scanner](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/rift-chunks), right-clicking a rift will either give you a coral fragment, paper, or place some coral blocks around the rift, it will also refill your Sonics artron reserve. once you have nine coral fragments (its easier to get 18 while you're at it) you can craft a growth by placing all nine of them in a crafting table. boom! now you have a coral growth, now time to grow a Tardis with it!

# STARTING TARDIS GROWTH

Now that you have a Coral Growth you can start growing it, to start the process we need to be in a rift chunk, to find one you can use a [Rift Scanner](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/rift-chunks) it will point in the direction of the nearest rift chunk. Once you're in a rift chunk you need a piece of soul sand just place it down then place the Coral Growth on top of it, and it should start growing! next up is the plasmatic shell which will be covered in [**Completing Tardis Growth**](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/tardis/completing_tardis_growth)
