      Welcome to the **Adventures In Time Wiki**! This wiki is constantly
      maintained to be up to date with the most recent version of AIT so you can
      get the best information of the mod, from useless features to useful
      blocks and even making datapacks or extra mods!


      ## Where do I get the most recent release?


      AIT can be found on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ait) and can also
      be found on
      [Curseforge.](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adventures-in-time)


      ## AIT is fantastic! Is there anywhere I can talk about the mod?


      Yes, in [Amble Labs' discord server](https://discord.gg/D5Et6Ux7BS) where
      you can talk about the mod, show off your interiors, post your AIT
      datapacks, pay to get beta previews and even play with other people in the
      **AIT Server**!


      ## I've made a super cool mod for AIT! But I don't know where to publish
      it?


      Oooh! In the [AIT Additons](https://discord.gg/aYEtPD24bF) Discord server,
      we would love to make a channel dedicated to talking about your addon. You
      can share your progress, get bug reports and suggestions and even update
      people on the changes! People can also play with your addons with other
      **AIT Addons** in the **AIT Additions Minecraft Server!**
