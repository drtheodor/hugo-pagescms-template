      #### Q: Is there a channel with all of the community addons?


      A: Yes, however some developers have their own servers, like:


      *   [AIT Extras](https://discord.gg/5JDKuzarcS)
          
      *   [AWT](https://discord.gg/pR4H948328)
          

      You can find the other addons in the addons channel on teh AmbleLabs
      discord server (make sure to get the AIT role first in `Channels &
      Roles`).

      #### Q: What do I choose: datapack or mod for making an addon for AIT?


      A: If you just want to add interiors, desktops, exterior and console
      variants, custom TARDIS names and etc., then feel free to create a
      datapack. Otherwise, making a mod is recommended. You can also use a
      datapack inside a mod.

      Q: What mods are incompatible with AIT?


      A: Below are currently known incompatibilities, if you know of any not
      listed here, please inform us!


      *   Immersive Portals: stops people from entering / exiting the TARDIS.
          
      *   No Nametag Render: will stop the control names from showing.
          
      *   Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (C2ME): seems to break rift chunks
      and TARDIS growth.
          
      *   Distant Horizons (when installed on the server): breaks TARDIS growth,
      causes server crashes when entering a TARDIS. Clientside plays like
      normal.

      #### Q: Can you add support for Immersive Portals / add your own BOTI


      A: We will not officially support Immersive Portals due to it not playing
      well with our mod. We briefly supported it but it proved to have plenty of
      issues. We are adding our own BOTI system and have some of it implemented
      now, however it will take time. Please be patient, it will be out when
      it's done. You can join our Discord serer to get mod teasers and updates
      to know when it's done!
