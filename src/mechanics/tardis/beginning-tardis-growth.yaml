      # FABRICATING A SONIC SCREWDRIVER


      to fabricate a sonic you're gonna need to find a blueprint for it; these
      blueprints can be found it all structures, you can see what the blueprint
      is for by pressing shift while hovering over it in your inventory. to use
      the blueprint you need a
      [fabricator](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/fabricator), next
      thing is to right-click the fabricator with the sonic blueprint, this will
      show all the items needed to fabricate the blueprint recipe I suggest
      going to get the items about now if you haven't already. once you have all
      the items needed you just right-click the fabricator while holding one of
      the items and the fabricator will take it, once you have placed all the
      items in the fabricator it will create the item, just right-click to
      obtain it, now that you have a sonic we can go on to getting coral
      fragments!


      # OBTAINING A CORAL GROWTH


      Now that you have a sonic screwdriver we can start getting coral
      fragments! nine coral fragments can used to make a coral growth which is
      key to growing a Tardis and a console for said Tardis, you can obtain
      coral fragments by right-clicking a
      [Rift](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/rift-chunks) with
      your sonic, a Rift is something that spawns in rift chunks that can be
      found using a [Rift
      Scanner](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/rift-chunks),
      right-clicking a rift will either give you a coral fragment, paper, or
      place some coral blocks around the rift, it will also refill your Sonics
      artron reserve. once you have nine coral fragments (its easier to get 18
      while you're at it) you can craft a growth by placing all nine of them in
      a crafting table. boom! now you have a coral growth, now time to grow a
      Tardis with it!


      # STARTING TARDIS GROWTH


      Now that you have a Coral Growth you can start growing it, to start the
      process we need to be in a rift chunk, to find one you can use a [Rift
      Scanner](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/rift-chunks) it
      will point in the direction of the nearest rift chunk. Once you're in a
      rift chunk you need a piece of soul sand just place it down then place the
      Coral Growth on top of it, and it should start growing! next up is the
      plasmatic shell which will be covered in [**Completing Tardis
      Growth**](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/tardis/completing_tardis_growth)
